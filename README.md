# **Memory Game**
The [‘Memory Game’](https://stephen-j-whitaker.github.io/memory-game/) is a game inspired by ‘Simon’, a memory game released in 1978 and is intended to be a fun and accessible way to test the short term memory skills of the player.

The Memory game plays a tone and ‘flashes’ one of the buttons and this should be copied by the player within a fixed period of time else the game will end. If the player successfully presses the same button, then another random button and corresponding tone is added to the sequence. If the player copies the whole sequence correctly then another button and tone is added and so on until the player copies the sequence incorrectly.

The game is what would be classed as a ‘retro’ game and it is designed to appeal to both new players who have not yet discovered the game and those who remember it from years gone by. For those that love the game ‘Memory Game’ will bring the game, that has traditionally been based on hardware implementations, into the realm of the world wide web where it can be enjoyed anywhere and anytime there is a connection to the internet. The interface is intuitive to new players and familiar to previous players and it’s hoped that it will give as much pleasure as the original, physical, game gave, and indeed still gives to so many today. 

The game is extremely easy to learn for those who are new to it and the combination of light and sound not only adds to the fun but also the games accessibility to those who are visually impaired.

## **1. Project Initiation**
- User stories
  
  User stories were ascertained for the game along with the features required to satisfy the user stories. A feature list was developed that covered all of the user stories requirements and it was ensured that there was no duplicated feature functionality going into development.

## **2. Game Development**
- ### **Game Functionality Development**

    - ### Mockups
       Mockups for the game were developed that incorporated all of the features identified during project initiation. 
       
       -  [Mobile mockups](docs/pdfs/readme-mobile-mockups.pdf)
       -  [Tablet mockups](docs/pdfs/readme-tablet-mockups.pdf)
       -  [Desktop mockups](docs/pdfs/readme-desktop-mockups.pdf)
       -  [User interface flow](docs/pdfs/readme-user-interface-flow.pdf)

- ### **Game Style Development**
  - ### Typography
    A limited set of fonts was used for the site in an attempt to ensure that the site retained a coherent feel where none of the sections looked out of place contributing to the user's enjoyment of the site.
    
    - Logo
    
      A sans serif font Oribitron, sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was selected for the game logo due to its retro game appearance. It is bold and easy to read drawing the user's attention to it and immediately identifying the site a memory game.

    - Site text

      The sans serif font Lato was selected for all other text on the site, again for the coherence of the site. It is easy to read at all sizes required for the site and on a wide range of devices. Lato was also source from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
    
    - 'Start' Button
      
      The SVG 'Start' button for the game uses the font 'Eras Bold ITC' sourced from within [Corel Draw](https://www.coreldraw.com/en/). The font is embedded as 'curves' in the SVG of the button to ensure it's always correctly positioned and scaled relative to the start button when the interface resizes in response to different screen sizes. It also removes the necessity to import the entire font into the site or create an additional external dependency.
