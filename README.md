# **Memory Game**
The ‘Memory Game’ is a game inspired by ‘Simon’, a memory game released in 1978 and is intended to be a fun and accessible way to test the short term memory skills of the player.

The Memory game plays a tone and ‘flashes’ one of the buttons and this should be copied by the player within a fixed period of time else the game will end. If the player successfully presses the same button, then another random button and corresponding tone is added to the sequence. If the player copies the whole sequence correctly then another button and tone is added and so on until the player copies the sequence incorrectly.

The game is what would be classed as a ‘retro’ game and it is designed to appeal to both new players who have not yet discovered the game and those who remember it from years gone by. For those that love the game ‘Memory Game’ will bring the game, that has traditionally been based on hardware implementations, into the real of the world wide web where it can be enjoyed anywhere and anytime there is a connection to the internet. The interface is intuitive to new players and familiar to previous players and it’s hoped that it will give as much pleasure as the original, physical, game gave, and indeed still gives to so many today. 

The game is extremely easy to learn for those who are new to it and the combination of light and sound not only adds to the fun but also the games accessibility to those who are visually impaired.
